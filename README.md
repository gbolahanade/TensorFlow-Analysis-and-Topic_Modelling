# Data Analysis and Topic Modeling of TensorFlow Posts and related tags on StackOverflow as at June 2023

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating advanced data analysis and topic modeling techniques of TensorFlow Posts. Additionally, the dataset required for analysis is provided in the repository via an external link.

## Contents

- **Tensorflow_data_analysis-REV01.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook demonstrating data analysis techniques of TensorFlow Posts. This notebook focuses on an in-depth exploration of the evolution of TensorFlow posts on StackOverflow, with a goal to uncover emerging trends, dissect prevalent research questions, and identify the core topics that have captivated the community's interest.
- **Tensorflow_topic_modelling-REV01.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook focused on topic modeling of TensorFlow Posts. The notebook includes steps for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation of topics extracted from the dataset using various natural language processing libraries.

## Dataset

The dataset used for both notebooks can be accessed via the following link:

- [Download Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M5yxMfm6bZT6bc_eNjrO3WFUKVd-OxB5/view?usp=drive_link)&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

Ensure you download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory before running the notebooks.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebooks, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- NumPy
